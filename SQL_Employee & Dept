For Table: https://github.com/mrityunjay2805/sql_practice/blob/main/Create%20Table%20Employee%20%26%20Department

1) write a query to print dep name and average salary of employees in that dep .

select d.dep_name, avg(salary) from employee e inner join dept d on e.dept_id = d.dep_id
group by d.dep_name


2) write a query to print dep names where none of the emplyees have same salary

select d.dep_name from employee e inner join dept d on e.dept_id = d.dep_id
group by d.dep_name
having count(distinct e.emp_id) = count(distinct e.salary)


3) write a query to print dep name for which there is no employee

select d.dep_name from dept d left join employee e on d.dep_id = e.dept_id
group by dep_name
having count(e.emp_id)= 0


4) write a query to print employees name for which dep id is not avaiable in dept table

select e.dept_id
from employee e left join dept d on e.dept_id = d.dep_id
where d.dep_id is null


5) write a query to print emp name , their manager name and diffrence in their age (in days) 
for employees whose year of birth is before their managers year of birth

select e1.emp_name as emp_name ,e2.emp_name as manager_name, DATEDIFF(DAY, e1.dob,e2.dob) as diff_in_age
from employee e1 inner join employee e2
on e1.manager_id = e2.emp_id
where DATEPART(Year, e2.dob) > DATEPART(Year, e1.dob)


6) write a query to print manager names along with the comma separated list(order by emp salary) of all employees 
directly reporting to him.

select e2.emp_name as manager_name, STRING_AGG(e1.emp_name,',') as emp_list
from employee e1 inner join employee e2 on e1.manager_id = e2.emp_id
group by e2.emp_name


7)  write a query to print emp name, manager name and senior manager name (senior manager is manager's manager)

select e1.emp_name as emp_name, e2.emp_name as mananger_name, e3.emp_name as senior_manager
from employee e1 inner join employee e2 on e1.manager_id = e2.emp_id
inner join employee e3 on e2.manager_id = e3.emp_id


8) Write departmet id which are not present in employee table but present in Dept table


Select dep_id from dept where dep_id not in 
(Select dept_id from employee)



9) Write a query to display emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary of that person and avg salary of the dept to 
which the emp belongs to.


select e.*, d.* from employee e
inner join
(select dept_id, avg(salary) as avg_dep_sal from employee
group by dept_id) d 
on e.dept_id = d.dept_id


Or we can use CTE (Commonn Table Expression)

With dep as 
(select dept_id, avg(salary) as avg_dep_sal from employee
group by dept_id)
select e.*, d.* from employee e
inner join dep d 
on e.dept_id = d.dept_id;



10) write a query to find employees whose salary is more than average salary of employees in their department

select * from employee e
inner join (select dept_id,avg(salary) as avg_sal from employee group by dept_id)  d
on e.dept_id=d.dept_id
where salary>avg_sal


11) write a query to find employees whose age is more than average age of all the employees.


select * from employee where emp_age > (select avg(emp_age) from employee)


12) write a query to print emp name, salary and dep id of highest salaried employee in each department 

select * from employee e1 inner join (select dept_id, max(salary) as max_sal from employee group by dept_id) as d1
on e1.dept_id = d1.dept_id where e1.salary = max_sal


 13) write a query to print emp name, salary and dep id of highest salaried employee overall

select * from employee 
where salary = (select max(salary) from employee)



***** WINDOWS FUNCTION *****

select * , ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by dept_id order by salary desc) as rn
from employee

select *, ROW_NUMBER() over(order by salary desc) as rn
from employee


14) Find top 2 highest salaried employee from each department.

Select * from (
select *, ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by dept_id order by salary desc) as rn
from employee ) as que
where rn <= 2


Or we can 

with cte as 
(select *, ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by dept_id order by salary desc) as rn
from employee )
select * from cte where rn <=2
