For Table: https://github.com/mrityunjay2805/sql_practice/blob/main/Create%20Table%20icc_world_cup

1) write a query to produce below output from icc_world_cup table. 
team_name, no_of_matches_played , no_of_wins , no_of_losses


select team_name, count(*) as matches_played, sum(win_flag) as matches_won, count(*) - sum(win_flag) as lost_matches
from
(select Team_1 as team_name, case when Team_1 = Winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup
union all
select Team_2 as team_name , case when Team_2 = Winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup) A
group by team_name

Or we can use CTE

With CTE (Common Table Expression)

With A as 
(select Team_1 as team_name, case when Team_1 = Winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup
union all
select Team_2 as team_name , case when Team_2 = Winner then 1 else 0 end as win_flag from icc_world_cup)
select team_name, count(*) as matches_played, sum(win_flag) as matches_won, count(*) - sum(win_flag) as lost_matches
from A group by team_name;
